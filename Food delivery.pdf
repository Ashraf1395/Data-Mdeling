Food Delivery

We have one fact table order to track details like order number,customer ,restaurant,recipe,delivery bill etc
The different dimension tables:
  Customer details to store customer details
  Delivery boy details
  Restaurant details
  Recipe details
We can use fact table to find which recipe is famous is in which restaurant or which restaurant gives which recipe
select recipe_name,restaunant_name from restaurant inner join order order o on r.restaurant_id=o.restaurant_id inner join recipe re on re.recipe_id=o.recipe_id 
group by o.restaurant_name
It was a basic example we can play around it by adding count of recipes and finding most famous recipe with windowing functions
or direclty among all recipe which is famous among customers  or which restaurant is most famous among customers
